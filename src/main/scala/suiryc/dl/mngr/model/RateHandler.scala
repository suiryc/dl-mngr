/**
 * Helper to compute live download rate.
 *
 * Time is divided in slices as for the rate limiter. The amount of downloaded
 * data is computed for the current slice each time the caller updates the
 * (total) downloaded size.
 * For smoother rate value changes, the following is done:
 *  - the rate is computed by taking into account multiple slices (spanning over
 *    the requested duration)
 *  - the oldest slice is only taken into account partially (depending on its
 *    start time relatively to the requested computation duration)
 *  - the time slice duration is aligned on the one used for rate limiting
 *  - when rate is limited, the current (ongoing) time slice is not taken into
 *    account: we assume that in the worst case data are downloaded at the start
 *    of the slice and download is paused for the rest of the slice
 * Also for better computation, it is recommended for caller to at least update
 * downloaded size once per time slice.
 *
 * Note: beware that computing the rate from 'downloaded' data (as read from the
 * content decoder) may result in a misleading 'burst' after disabling rate
 * limiting: the underlying connection has received data (buffered) but rate
 * limiting does limit how many we actually process per time period, so when
 * removing the limit we suddenly drain the buffer which artificially increases
 * the rate (possibly exceeding the physical limit of the connection).
 *
 * @param rateLimiter the download rate limiter
 * @param startValue the current downloaded size
 * @param duration time duration over which the rate is computed
